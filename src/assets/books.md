# My current TOP 3

_31 July 2023_

---

### James Clear's _Atomic Habits_

- To achieve anything significant, you'll need strong fundamentals.
  This book provides you with that and more.

### Paulo Coelho's _The Alchemist_

- This story made me more aware of my deep desire to achieve the goals that I've set in the
  course of my life. Everything is possible. You just have to be willing to go the path.

### Yuval Noah Harari's _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_

- Why is our society the way it is? Why is enough never really enough? Why do you exist?
  This is one of the books that I'm really grateful for having read. I would really like to
  attend to one of Harari's lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sometime.
